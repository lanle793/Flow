# Flow

A VR game where the player uses a ladle to mix ingredients in a pan following a certain trajectory. Hit points are represented as triangles along the trajectory.
Moving the ladle close to the triangles add points to the player's score. The ultimate objective is to integrate this with Vicon Nexus to track the movement of players and extract useful data.
